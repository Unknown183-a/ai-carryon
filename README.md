# AI CarryON — Autonomous Multi-Channel YouTube Shorts Platform

An autonomous AI system that discovers trending topics, researches them, writes scripts, generates voiceovers, renders Shorts, writes SEO metadata, and uploads to YouTube with no human in the loop. It then tracks how each video performs and feeds that data back into what it makes next.

It runs **four independent production channels**, each with its own content source, audience, credentials, and schedule, all deployed as scheduled GitHub Actions workflows.

**Dashboard**: <https://ai-carryon-tqndlmjbcfvtznagmef2ap.streamlit.app/Dashboard>
**Repo**: <https://github.com/Unknown183-a/ai-carryon>
**Channels**: [English](https://www.youtube.com/@AIcarryONAI) · [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONHindi) · [Cricket](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONSports) · [Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONGaming)

## Channels in Production

| Channel | Audience / Niche | Content source | Voice | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **English** ([@AIcarryONAI](https://www.youtube.com/@AIcarryONAI)) | US, Tech/AI | Trending-topic discovery + LLM research | Edge TTS | `english-scheduler.yml` (every 5h) |
| **Hindi** ([@AICarryONHindi](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONHindi)) | India, experiment-style videos (chemical, physical and technology experiments from around the world) | LLM-generated trending topics, Hinglish scripts | Sarvam AI Bulbul, Edge TTS fallback | `hindi-scheduler.yml` (hourly check, adaptive, max 3 uploads/day) |
| **Cricket** ([@AICarryONSports](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONSports)) | Cricket news and match content | CricAPI match data + trending cricket topics | Edge TTS | `cricket-scheduler.yml` |
| **Gaming** ([@AICarryONGaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AICarryONGaming)) | Gaming moments and trends | Twitch Helix Clips API (followed streamers + top clips by game category) | Edge TTS | `gaming-scheduler.yml` |

The Hindi channel was pivoted from tech news to experiment-style videos after poor retention, to make content more visual and interactive.

## What Each Pipeline Does

Every channel runs on its own schedule and, without human input:

1. Checks whether the current hour matches a learned peak-engagement window (English/Hindi; falls back to safe defaults until enough data exists)
2. Finds a trending topic, filtered to the channel's niche
3. Checks topic saturation and skips topics that are already over-covered (English/Hindi)
4. Benchmarks competitors on the same topic (English/Hindi)
5. Researches the topic and writes a script tuned to the channel's length and style
6. Generates three title variations using different psychological patterns, scores them, and picks a winner
7. Writes the SEO description and hashtags
8. Generates a voiceover and word-by-word captions
9. Pulls background footage: topic-relevant Pexels video clips (English, Hindi, Cricket), or real Twitch clips downloaded with `yt-dlp` (Gaming)
10. Renders the final video with ffmpeg
11. Uploads to YouTube with full metadata
12. Records view snapshots on a schedule for ongoing analytics

### Pipeline (per channel)

```
Adaptive Hour Check -> Trending Topic (niche-filtered)
    -> Saturation Check -> Competitor Comparison
    -> Research (LLM) -> Script
    -> A/B Title Test -> SEO
    -> Voiceover -> Captions
    -> Background footage (Pexels clips / Twitch clips)
    -> Video render (ffmpeg) -> YouTube upload
    -> View snapshots -> Postgres (channel-tagged)
```

## Architecture

**Compute and scheduling.** Each channel is a GitHub Actions cron workflow (`.github/workflows/`). Runs are stateless, so all state lives in Postgres and all credentials in GitHub Secrets.

**LLM routing.** Groq (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`) is the primary model, with Gemini (`gemini-3.5-flash`) as fallback. The English and Hindi routing layers (`model_invoke_agent_english.py`, `model_invoke_agent_hindi.py`) include circuit breakers and per-run call budgets so a provider outage or rate limit degrades gracefully instead of failing a run.

**Data.** Supabase Postgres, accessed through the transaction pooler (port 6543), because GitHub Actions runners are IPv4-only and Supabase direct connections are IPv6-only. English and Hindi share one database, partitioned by a `channel` column so their learning never mixes. Cricket uses its own Supabase project for topic de-duplication.

**Dashboard.** A Streamlit app on Streamlit Community Cloud reads the same Postgres database. Pages: Dashboard, Peak Hours, Schedule, Analytics, Comparison, and A/B Titles. The channel selector covers English, Hindi, and Cricket.

**Shared rendering.** Every channel reuses the same video renderer (`agents/video_agent.py`), so a fix or improvement there benefits all four.

### Repository Layout

```
agents/            English pipeline agents + shared video/voice/caption agents
agents_hindi/      Hindi (Hinglish) pipeline agents
agents_cricket/    Cricket pipeline agents
agents_gaming/     Gaming pipeline agents (Twitch client, clip finder, etc.)
pages/             Streamlit dashboard pages
scheduler.py, scheduler_hindi.py, scheduler_cricket.py, scheduler_gaming.py
app.py             Streamlit entrypoint
.github/workflows/ english / hindi / cricket / gaming scheduler workflows
```

## Intelligence Layer (English and Hindi)

| Component | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Velocity and peak-hour detection** | Computes views gained per hour per video, aggregated by hour of day, to find the best upload windows |
| **Saturation engine** | Scores topics 0-100 from recent competing video count and authority-channel coverage. Fails open if the YouTube API is unavailable |
| **Comparison engine** | Benchmarks the top 10 competing videos (views, engagement, title length, duration) and feeds recommendations into script and SEO generation |
| **A/B title testing** | Generates 3 titles from 8 psychological patterns, scores each on a 10-point rubric, and logs every test for pattern tracking |
| **Adaptive scheduling** | Generates and uploads only when the current hour matches a learned peak window (minimum 3 samples), with default hours as fallback |
| **View tracking** | Hourly snapshots of views, likes, and comments per video |

---

## Engineering Highlights

- **Moved off paid hosting to a zero-cost deployment.** English and Hindi were migrated from Railway (which began requiring a credit card) to GitHub Actions cron workflows. The SQLite store was replaced with Postgres so state survives across stateless runs. The gaming channel was built directly on the same pattern.
- **Replaced the database layer.** The original per-feature JSON files became a single SQLite database and then Supabase Postgres, with an idempotent migration script and a timezone fix for mixed naive/aware timestamps that had silently broken velocity calculation.
- **Survived a model deprecation.** When Groq retired `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, roughly 25 hardcoded call sites across all channels were migrated to `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, and a retired Gemini model in the routing layer was replaced.
- **Upgraded visuals from static to dynamic.** Ken-Burns still images were replaced with topic-relevant Pexels video clips for English and Hindi.
- **Fixed silent audio truncation in Hindi TTS.** Sarvam splits long text into multiple WAV segments and only the first was being saved, cutting about 70% of each voiceover. Concatenating all segments fixed it, and script length was retuned to 110-130 words to stay under the 60-second Shorts limit.
- **Built the gaming pipeline end to end.** Twitch OAuth app registration, Helix Clips API integration, per-clip download with `yt-dlp`, and a category filter that automatically excludes non-gameplay categories (Just Chatting, Music, ASMR, etc.) from top-clip discovery.
- **Cricket state moved to Postgres.** De-duplication tracking was moved from a JSON file to Supabase so it survives ephemeral compute.

| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection (Supabase transaction pooler) | All |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Primary LLM inference | All |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | LLM fallback | All |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | Background clips and images | English, Hindi, Cricket |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | YouTube Data API (search, public stats) | All |
| `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_B64`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRETS_B64`, `YOUTUBE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN_B64` | English OAuth upload and analytics credentials | English |
| `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON` | Hindi OAuth token (needs `youtube.upload` and `youtube.readonly` scopes) | Hindi |

## Deployment

All four pipelines deploy the same way: push to `main`, and the scheduled workflows in `.github/workflows/` pick up the new code on their next run. Secrets live in GitHub repository secrets. To trigger a run without waiting for the cron, use "Run workflow" on the relevant workflow in the Actions tab.

---

## Operational Notes

- **YouTube API quota**: 10,000 units/day per Google Cloud project, and each upload costs about 1,650 units. The gaming channel uses its own Google Cloud project and OAuth client.
- **OAuth tokens** can expire (`invalid_grant`). Re-authenticate locally and update the matching GitHub secret. A Hindi token with upload-only scope silently fails view tracking with a 403.
- **Sarvam text limits**: long scripts come back as multiple audio chunks, so always concatenate every returned segment.
- **Flow/Veo clips**: an optional manual mode for cinematic clips exists in the English and Hindi agents (`flow_prompt_agent.py`), but the automated pipelines use Pexels or Twitch footage. Real brand names in clip prompts can trigger Flow's policy filter.

## Comment Reply Agent

One shared engine (`agents/comment_engine.py`) with thin per-channel wrappers
(`comment_reply_agent.py` in `agents/`, `agents_hindi/`, `agents_cricket/`). English and Hindi run it from
their scheduler once per IST day (any time 19:00-23:59 IST, tracked in the DB so a late GitHub cron still
counts); Cricket runs it from its own `14:00 UTC` cron (`--comments`).

- One LLM call per comment returns category + reply + topic. Spam/Offensive are never answered.
- State lives in the database (`comment_history`, `topic_requests`; cricket: `cricket_comment_history`,
  `cricket_match_requests`), not `output/*.json`, which Actions wipes every run.
- A comment is only finished once the reply is posted, deliberately skipped, or failed permanently. LLM/API
  hiccups are retried on the next run (3 attempts).
- A missing `youtube.force-ssl` scope, expired token or exhausted quota aborts the run with the fix in the log.
- Skips the channel's own comments and threads that already have a reply; never posts links or @mentions.
- Per-run caps: 25 replies, 15 minutes, newest 250 threads.
- `COMMENT_AUTO_REPLY=false` is a dry run (drafts stored, nothing posted); `COMMENT_FORCE=true` ignores the
  window. Both are inputs on the English/Hindi/Cricket workflows' manual "Run workflow" button.
- Tokens must include `youtube.force-ssl`: `generate_english_token.py`, `generate_hindi_token_v3.py`,
  `generate_cricket_token.py` (the old cricket token cannot post; regenerate it).
- Tests: `python -m unittest tests.test_comment_engine -v`

## Known Limitations

- Sarvam Hindi TTS currently errors on `target_language_code` and falls back to Edge TTS
- Custom thumbnail upload is blocked by a 403 on some channels (likely requires channel phone verification)
- The comment-reply agent needs the `youtube.force-ssl` OAuth scope (see the Comment Reply Agent section); Gaming and Bhakti have no comment agent yet
- Saturation gating is not bypassed by `FORCE_GENERATE` (only the schedule-hour gate is)

---

## Roadmap

- **Close the A/B loop**: title scores are LLM-predicted today. Validate them against real 24h view counts and let pattern selection use ground truth.
- **Extend the intelligence layer to Cricket and Gaming**: saturation, comparison, and adaptive scheduling currently run for English and Hindi only.
- **Failure and hook analysis**: systematic tracking of why videos underperform.
- **Audience, opportunity, and monetization intelligence**: demographic pulls, pre-trend prediction, and RPM-correlated topic scoring.
- **Centralized "brain" service**: deliberately deferred until the pipeline stabilized. With four channels now running the same pattern, it is the natural next abstraction.
- **Multi-tenant SaaS rebuild**: a from-scratch rebuild of this pipeline as a multi-tenant platform (FastAPI, Firebase, Celery workers on Cloud Run) lives in [ai-carryon-saas](https://github.com/Unknown183-a/ai-carryon-saas).
