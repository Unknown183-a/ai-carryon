# agents/model_invoke_agent_english.py
"""
Shared LLM invocation router for the English pipeline.

This is the English-side twin of agents_hindi/model_invoke_agent_hindi.py.
Kept as a separate module (not shared code) on purpose: the two channels run
as independent processes/services with independent Groq/Gemini quotas, so
each needs its own independent call budget and circuit-breaker state — one
channel hitting its rate limit or losing a provider must never affect the
other channel's counters.

Problem it solves:
- Every agent (script, seo, ab_title, flow_prompt, research, thumbnail,
  image, manim, comment_reply, trending, ...) used to define its own
  safe_invoke()/get_llm() with a 20s-timeout-then-Gemini fallback, or in a
  few cases (comment_reply_agent, trending_agent, manim_agent) had NO
  fallback at all. None of them knew how many Groq calls had already
  happened this run, and ChatGroq's own SDK was retrying 429s internally
  for 5-9+ seconds each time, burning minutes before ever falling back.
- One video generation run makes 10-15+ LLM calls (trending, saturation,
  comparison, research, script + retries, 3x A/B titles + scoring, SEO,
  thumbnail text, flow prompts). On a free/low-tier Groq plan that alone
  can exceed the requests-per-minute limit.

Fix, part 1 — proactive rate-limit avoidance:
- A single process-wide counter tracks Groq calls made so far *this run*.
- Once GROQ_MAX_CALLS_PER_RUN is hit, remaining calls skip Groq entirely and
  go straight to Gemini — proactively, before the real 429 wall.
- ChatGroq is created with max_retries=0 so a 429 fails fast (instead of the
  SDK silently backing off for 5-9s per call) and control returns to the
  router immediately to decide what happens next.

Fix, part 2 — circuit breaker for a fully-dead provider:
- If Groq isn't just rate-limited but genuinely down/broken (bad key, outage,
  quota fully exhausted for the day), every call would otherwise still try
  Groq first, wait out its timeout, and only then fall back — wasting the
  timeout on every single call for the rest of the run.
- Instead: after LLM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD consecutive failures on a
  provider, that provider is marked "dead" for the rest of the run and is
  skipped entirely — the other provider carries the whole run from then on.
- Works both directions: Groq dead -> Gemini carries on. Gemini dead ->
  Groq carries on (budget/circuit permitting). Only if BOTH are dead does
  the router fall to a last-ditch smaller Groq model, and only raises if
  that also fails.
