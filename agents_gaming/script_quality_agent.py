# agents_gaming/script_quality_agent.py
"""
Gaming V2 Phase 5 — a script is only good enough to voice if hook strength,
naturalness, originality, accuracy and moment relevance are ALL above the
threshold (spec: > 7). Otherwise the caller regenerates it with this agent's
feedback; a weak script is never uploaded just because generation succeeded.

Two layers:
  1. Deterministic checks (no LLM): invented numbers cap accuracy, repeated
     AI phrases cap naturalness, near-duplicate of a recent script caps
     originality. These cannot be talked around by a lenient judge.
  2. LLM judge: scores the five dimensions plus pacing / payoff / repetition
     / AI-pattern notes.

If the judge call itself fails (provider outage, unparsable reply) the script
is flagged `unjudged` and does NOT pass (fail closed) — an unreviewed script
is never published; the scheduler just skips this cycle and the next cron run
tries again. GAMING_ALLOW_UNJUDGED=1 restores the old fail-open behaviour.

Score 1-10 (be harsh; 8+ means a human creator could have said it):
- hook: does the first line stop a scroll without giving the payoff away?
- naturalness: sounds like a person talking, not an AI announcer (varied rhythm, no cliches)
- originality: a specific angle on THIS moment, not a generic hype template
- accuracy: every claim is supported by the moment analysis / clip data
- moment_relevance: it is about what actually happens in the clip
